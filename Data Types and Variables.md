Strings
-------

When we write string in Python we can write within double quotes ("") or single quotes (''). It is very important to note that the quotes tells the computer where does the string begin and where does it ends. That being said if you use double quote to start and finish your string you cannot use double quotes inside the string. Now you may ask... But what if a sentence needs both double and single quotes? Great question!

We can use escape sequence but more on that later ðŸ˜›
