Jargon
======

arguments
---------

Arguments are the value that we passes inside the parenthesis of a function or class.

function
--------

We can think of a function as a small program that perform an specific task.

```python
print('Game Over')
```

In the example above we "call" a `function` named print().

To call a `function` we type in the name of the `function` followed by the parenthesis and the argument if necessary.

An argument is the value we passed inside the parenthesis.
In our example our `function` will be print() and our argument is 'Game Over'

string
------

```python
print('Game Over')
```

In this particular example the value passed inside the parenthesis is called a `string`.

A `string` is series of characters. In plain English words or text. In Python a `string` is normally enclosed on either single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`)

statement
---------

In plain English, a statement is a complete thought. However, in Python, a statement is a complete instruction. All the programs contains a number of statements.

syntax highlighting
-------------------

You may have notice that when you type certain words, some of the have different colors. This is referred as syntax highlighting, and it helps us to have a visual representation of what we are typing by categorizing it. In the long run when we create larger programs this will helps us to spot errors easier.

directory
---------

A fancier term used for a folder in your computer or storage device.

interpreter
-----------

An interpreter is a program that executes the instructions written in a programming language, without previously compiling into machine program.

compiler
--------

Usually a compiler converts a high-level programming language to a low-level programming language such as Assembly, Object Code or Machine code.

High-Level Programming Language
-------------------------------

In simpler terms a High-Level Programming Language is a language that may use English like elements, making it easier to use and understand. (Python is a high-level programming language.)

Low-Level Programming Language
------------------------------

Contrary to a High-Level a low-level language is exponentially harder to understand as it is closer to computer language. Usually refers to Machine Code or Assembly.

concatenation
-------------

Concatenations is the term used to link things together in a chain or series. This term is use in coding when we use the plus sign to add two string together.
