function
--------
We can think of a function as a small program that perform an specific task.

```python
print('Game Over')
```
In the example above we "call" a `function` named print(). 

To call a `function` we type in the name of the `function` followed by the parentesis and the argument if necesesary.

An argument is the value we passed inside the parenthesis.
In our example our `function` will be print() and our argument is 'Game Over'

string
------
```python
print('Game Over')
```
In this particular example the value passed inside the parenthesis is called a `string`.

A `string` is series of characters. In plain English words or text. In Python a `string` is normally enclosed on either single quotes (`''`) or double quotes (`""`)

statement
---------
In plain English, a statement is a complete thought. However, in Python, a statement is a complete instruction. All the programs contains a number of statements.

syntax highlighting
-------------------
You may have notice that when you type certain words, some of the have different colors. This is refered as syntax highlighting, and it helps us to have a visual representation of what we are typing by categorzing it. In the long run when we create larger programs this will helps us to spot errors easier.

directory
---------
A fancier term used for a folder in your computer or storage device.
