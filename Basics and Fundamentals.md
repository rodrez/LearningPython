Basics and Fundamentals
=======================

Saving a Python program
-----------------------
When we are done typing our statements and our code looks beautiful and perfect we need to save the file in order to run our program.
We can name the file whatever we want. However, its necessary that we name the extension `.py` for example. `myawesomeprogram.py`. See the picture below for reference.

Running a Python program
------------------------

We can run a Python program using a lot of different methods, in this case we are going to use what we call a console window, such as `Terminal` for Mac users or `Poweshell` for Windows users, both of these should come with your respective computer.

We need to ensure that we are in the right directory.

> Mac Users

In terminal we can type the following commands to perform different actions. For now we are only going to use 3 commands.

- `cd` - is short for change directory. Guess what it does???? Yup! You got it it allows us to change directories by typing `cd directoryname`. But what is a directory you mas ask? Great question! Its simply a folder in your computer.

- `ls` - stand for 'list files'. I know, I know... Shouldn't it be 'lf'? I agree with you, unfortunately, the guy who created decided that `ls` was more fitting ðŸ™ƒ. Now, you might wondering whhat does `ls` do. Guess... Jeez you are so smart, I don't even know why are you reading this, you are right `ls` list all files and directories in your currect folder/directory.

- `python` - with the python command we also need to pass the name of the file **with** the extesion `.py` in order to run our program.

Now, with all these commands you should be ready to run your Python programs! Are you excited yet?! I am!

> Windows Users 



1. Open `Terminal`, `Powershell` or your console window of preference.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python file you want to run is located.
>> Rememeber to use `cd` and `ls` to find your file
3. Type `python yourfile.py` and hit enter.
4. Brag to your friends and family members of how godly of a programmer you are!
