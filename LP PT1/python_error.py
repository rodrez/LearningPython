primt('War. War never changes.')

# Computers takes everything literally 
# So if you misspell any functions the program will give you an error.
# Given the statement above we can notice that print() is misspelled. 
# So the computer is like Huh?! What is that suppose to mean?

# Arguably the most important line in the error output would be,
# NameError: name 'primt' is not defined
# This is saying: Hey I checked all the functions and I did not find anything named `primt` 

# Now there is also a line that read as follows:
#   File "python_error.py", line 1, in <module> 
# The interpreter says... "Hey human your issue is happening at line on the file call python_error.py"
# This makes our life easier and as a programmer you will need to learn how to read this errors properly.
# Remember that a programer job 90% of the time is figuring out where are the errors in our codes
