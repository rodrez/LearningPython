# This program will print game  over and ask for the user to hit any key to exit

# Hopefully you are familiar with our old friend the print function
# If you forgot don't worry, it displays the `string` inside the parenthesis.
print("An enemy has been slayed...")

# A new function showed up! What do we do?
# Similar to print, if you pass a string inside the parenthisis, it will display the value
# What is the difference you may ask? Well, instead of just printing `input` prompts the user to take some action
# In this case it prompts the user to press any key to exit the program
# Now this is a simple trick to keep our program running until the press any key
# We will go into more details about input later on... sorry... just wait a little bit ðŸ˜… 
input('Press any key to exit...')
