# Using Quotes Examples
# A friendly reminder that quotes tells the computer where does the string start and where does it ends.

print("Get over here! - Scorpion MK \n")

# Notice how double quotes are part of the string because the starting and ending are single quotes.
print('"A hero need not speak. When he is gone, the world will speak for him." - Halo\n')

# Contrary to the previous line of code, in this we use double quotes, then use a single quote inside the string.
print("It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum... and I'm all outta gum. - Duke Nukem\n")

# By default the print function adds a new line as the final value. However you can change the final value by using the end=''
# In the example below we use -Ezio as an example however, you can even pass nothing, or whatever you want.
print('Nothing is true, everything is permitted.', end=' -Ezio')
